The Bitcoin proof-of-work process has an adjustable difficulty based on the current amount of mining, so a Bitcoin miner's job is to find a number called, in this context, a _nonce_ to add to A to get a resulting B less than the difficulty value.  We will set our difficulty value at $2^{253}$.  Try out a few numbers by changing the value of X and see if you can find one that hashes to less than $2^{253}$!"
