    "Real world data such as pictures and music in the analog world can be represented digitally for computers to use and process. In this tutorial you will see how data can be represented in a variety of commonly used formats in computer science and programming. You will also learn about some basic Python functions designed to manipulate these representations, as well as a specialized library called BitVector.\n",

    "Computers use the binary system, usually consisting of two symbols `1` and `0`, to represent data. This is nothing but the base-2 system, just like we use the base-10 system in everyday life. Internally, these two symbols are mapped to physical quantities such as two voltage levels +5 volts/-5 volts, or the presence/absence of a magnetic field, in order for a computer to process the data. Let us see how binary representation works, for the decimal number 5. In python, to get the binary representation of the number 5, use the `bin` function:"
