When you mix these colors in different proportions, you get different colors! The amount of each color is indicated by a number in the range 0 through 255. This choice of numbers isn't arbitrary: the total number of choices, 256, is a power of 2 ($2^8 = 256$). Again, it is quite common to deal with numbers that are powers of two in programming.\n",
