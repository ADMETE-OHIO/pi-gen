    "Real world data such as pictures and music in the analog world can be represented digitally for computers to use and process. In this tutorial you will see how data can be represented in a variety of commonly used formats in computer science and programming. You will also learn about some basic Python functions designed to manipulate these representations, as well as a specialized library called BitVector.\n",
